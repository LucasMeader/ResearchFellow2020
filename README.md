# ResearchFellow2020
I wrote this code during my Medical Imaging Research Fellow role at the University of Surrey at the start of 2020.
The main part of my role was to analyse simulated x-ray images using metrics such as Contrast, 
Contrast to Noise Ratio (CNR) and Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR).
The visualisations I created with my code using these measurements helped the scientific team see 
where their new x-ray system could be improved.
